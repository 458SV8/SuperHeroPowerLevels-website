# SuperHeroPowerLevels-website

This visualization is inspired by classic superhero trading cards. It uses cubes to
show power levels for attributes like Intelligence, Strength, Speed, Durability, and
Power. The marks are cubes (showing power levels), text (for names and labels),
and images (representing the superhero). The channels are length (number of
filled cubes showing magnitude), color (blue for filled and grey for empty), and text
styling (bold and size for emphasis). Design Category: This is a "novel"
visualization because it uses a unique and interactive representation of superhero
data.
